# chip8-emu
My first time making an emulator. It was quite a ride.

## Usage
Run the emulator and simply enter the location of your game ROM.
To exit click the `X` or `CTRL-C` in the terminal.

## Installation

1. Install SDL2
2. Clone git repo with `git clone https://github.com/MarkoBorkovic/chip8-emu.git`
3. Run `make` command if you are on Linux, and if you are on window lookup on how to compile SDL2 C programs
